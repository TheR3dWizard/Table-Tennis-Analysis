ABSTRACT = {Detecting serve fouls in table tennis is critical for ensuring fair play. This paper explores the development of foul detection of table tennis serves by leveraging 3D ball trajectory analysis and deep learning techniques. Using a multi-camera setup and a custom dataset, we employed You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for ball detection and Transformers for critical trajectory point identification. We achieved 87.52% precision in detecting fast-moving balls and an F1 score of 0.93 in recognizing critical serve points such as the throw, highest, and hit points. These results enable precise serve segmentation and robust foul detection based on criteria like toss height and vertical angle compliance. The approach simplifies traditional methods by focusing solely on the ball motion, eliminating computationally intensive pose estimation. Despite limitations such as a controlled experimental environment, the findings demonstrate the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven referee systems for table tennis games, providing a foundation for broader applications in sports officiating.},

abstract = {The control problem—which of its potential actions should an AI system perform at each point in the problem-solving process?—is fundamental to all cognitive processes. This paper proposes eight behavioral goals for intelligent control and a ‘blackboard control architecture’ to achieve them. The architecture distinguishes domain and control problems, knowledge, and solutions. It enables AI systems to operate upon their own knowledge and behavior and to adapt to unanticipated problem-solving situations. The paper shows how opm, a blackboard control system for multiple-task planning, exploits these capabilities. It also shows how the architecture would replicate the control behavior of hearsay-ii and hasp. The paper contrasts the blackboard control architecture with three alternatives and shows how it continues an evolutionary progression of control architectures. The paper concludes with a summary of the blackboard control architecture's strengths and weaknesses.}

abstract = {Since Hearsay-II, many application systems using the blackboard architecture have been built. Some of these applications have been built using expert system shells or tools. These tools contain the skeletal constructs of blackboard systems into which the user adds the necessary information and knowledge from the application domain to create an application system. Although the tools are useful in the implementation phase, they provide little help in the design of the system, which must necessarily precede the implementation phase. The determination of the blackboard levels, the knowledge sources, and the details of the control strategy is a task reserved for the knowledge engineer/system designer. In order to automate the design process, one needs to understand the relationships between the architectural constructs and domain information that provide the semantics of the architecture. In this paper the authors explore the components of blackboard systems from the perspective of the type of knowledge that goes into the makeup of blackboard systems at the architecture level. They describe a research system, KASE, that captures the various knowledge needed for design and applies the knowledge to aid knowledge engineers design blackboard systems.}
